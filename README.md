# Wallet Analysis

## Project Overview
Wallet Analysis is a full-stack web application designed to provide insights and analysis into cryptocurrency wallets. It consists of a backend service developed in Python and a frontend application that serves an intuitive user interface for interaction. The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and manage across different environments.

## Installation
To install and run the Wallet Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wallet-analysis.git
   cd wallet-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Docker**: Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can download Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

3. **Build and Run the Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file and start them.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost`. The backend services will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. You can interact with the application through the web interface, which will allow you to analyze various cryptocurrency wallets.

## Features
- **Real-time Data Analysis**: Analyze wallet transactions and balances in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive frontend built to enhance user experience.
- **Dockerized Environment**: The application runs in isolated containers, simplifying deployment and scaling.

## Dependencies
While the specific contents of `package.json` were not provided, typically for a full-stack app, you might expect dependencies for both frontend and backend.

Here would typically be listed any relevant dependencies. For example (please update these sections with actual dependencies your project may require):
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, Redux, etc.
- **Backend**: Flask, Django, Flask-RESTful, etc.

If you have `package.json` files available for both frontend and backend, please check and add relevant dependencies here.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
wallet-analysis/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # Dockerfile for backend
│   ├── app/                # Application code for backend
│   └── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── Dockerfile          # Dockerfile for frontend
│   ├── src/               # Source code for frontend
│   └── package.json        # JavaScript dependencies
│
└── docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration file
```

This structure separates the backend and frontend code to allow for better organization and easier maintenance.

## Conclusion
Wallet Analysis is a flexible and powerful tool for cryptocurrency wallet analysis. By leveraging modern web technologies and containerization, this project aims to simplify the process of accessing and analyzing wallet data. Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests!
